### Features:

- **BMI Calculation:** Calculates the BMI based on the formula BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2).
- **BMI Category:** Determines the BMI category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese) based on the calculated BMI value.
- **Clear and Responsive Interface:** Provides a clear and responsive interface for users to input their data and view the calculated BMI and category.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Input your height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) into the designated fields.
4. Click on the "Calculate" button to see your BMI and category.
